<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Civil Servants for the East India Company used to be nominated by the Directors
of the Company and thereafter trained at Haileybury College in London and then sent to
India. Following Lord Macaulayâ€™s Report of the Select Committee of British Parliament,
the concept of a merit based modern Civil Service in India was introduced in 1854. The
Report recommended that patronage based system of East India Company should be
replaced by a permanent Civil Service based on a merit based system with entry
through competitive examinations
